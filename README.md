# VideoKitchen
A simple video scene shuffler. Scenes are defined at random as determined by a chunk size. Note: I am aware that `os.system()` is dangerous. I made this script for entertainment purposes.

## Usage
`python linux-build.py [FILENAME]`
`python windows-build.py [FILENAME]`

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.8+
2. FFMPEG
